# Ansible
#
### Notes
- Acquired by Red Hat
- Use Cases: 
	o Automation
	o Change Management - production server changes
	o Provisioning
	o Orchestration - large scale automation, integrating with other cloud tools like jenkins
- No agents of any sort required, uses API/WINRM/SSH
- YAML; no databases
- Simple setup, a single python library; no residual software

### Setting up
1. Ansible control instance using Ubuntu and bootstrap instructions from docs; add -y
	$ sudo apt update
	$ sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
	$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
	$ sudo apt install ansible -y
2. 2 web servers instances and 1 db server instance-all w/centos 7; port 22 access with inbound access from Ansible Control instance.

### Using Inventory & Ping
###### located ./inventory
1. Within control instance, created a local file called inventory and added data for the web and db instances in the following format:
	- <instanceName> ansible_host=<privateIP> ansible_user=<name> ansible_ssh_private_key_file=<keyName>
2. Separately created another file locally that had the .pem key data used for ssh access to each instance, needs to match <keyName>; made file read-only (chmod 400)
3. ansible -i inventory -m ping web01
	- i to indicate inventory file followed by name
	- m to indicate what module we want to use followed by module name (ping)
	- ping - tries to connect to host, verify a usable python (/usr/bin/python), returns a pong on success through a .json file
		o can use * (need to surround with ') or all
4. Removing host-key checking
	- WHY? Using host-key checking (the response you have to say yes to after you send a ping) adds an interactive step that we don't want if we're looking to automate
	- sudo vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
		o uncomment host_key_checking = False
5. Adding groups
	- using square brackets in inventory file; can categories each instance within a group
	- e.g. [<groupName>]
			web01
			web02
	- to group the groups can use [<newGroupName>:children] - followed by group names in the lines below
6. Defining variables at group level: [<groupName>:vars]
	- can define 'ansible_user=' and 'ansible_ssh_private_key_file=' below
	- group must already be previously defined
	- if variables are defined at host level (top of the line) then group variables won't even be checked

### Ad Hoc commands
- ad-hoc commands that deal with configuration management are idempotent; after the first application, same execution won't apply again
- yum module
	o need to use -a for attributes
	o need to use sudo if the user doesn't have root privileges (--become)
	o e.g. ansible -i <inventoryName> -m yum -a "name=<package you want to install> state=<installed>" <instanceName> --become
- service module
	o controls services (e.g. can start/shutdown)
	o e.g. "... -m service -a "name=<package> enabled=<boolean> state=<started>" ..."
- copy module
	o module that copies the file that you identify

### Playbook
###### ./web_db.yaml
- written in YAML - Ansible playbooks run multiple tasks, assign roles, and define configurations, deployment steps, and variables. If youâ€™re using multiple servers, Ansible playbooks organize the steps between the assembled machines or servers and get them organized and running in the way the users need them to.
- can check syntax with: ansible-playbook -i <inventoryName> <filename> --syntax-check
- to execute: ansible-playbook -i <inventoryName> <filename>
- to conduct dry-run: ansible-playbook -i <inventoryName> <filename> -C

### Modules
###### ./db.yaml
- Details of a package: ansible-doc <package>
- Sometimes you'll find errors in executing a module due to missing dependencies, in these cases you'll need to search in the instance to see if it exists
	o e.g. if a package is needed in an centos OS, you can search using "yum search" and "grep -i <name>" to see if it exists
	o once found, we'll have to add remotely through the playbook

### Ansible Configuration
- priority of settings: 
	1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG (env variable if set)
	2. ansible.cfg (in the current directory) - most commonly used
	3. ~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
	4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (global config file)
- ./ansible.cfg (default file)
	o basic default values are shown in the beginning to show paths/location
	o forks - defines parallel execution of how many machine it will simultaneously execute at a time
	o no default log file but you can uncomment it in config (line 113) to create one
	o privilege_escalation (line 342), escalated privilege for all the playbooks in the selected directory (global/home/current)
	o configuration file in docs.ansible site has details for every setting
- ./ansibleCustom.cfg (customized file)
	o log_path = <location of where you want the log file>
		- keep in mind, if you choose a path like /var/log/ansible.log, consider who the user would be executing this .cfg file as
		- e.g. if a normal user on ubuntu is the standard user, then they won't have access to this directory unless they use root
		- you'll have to create the ansible.log first, give the user, who is executing the playbook, ownership, then access the file
